export const sampleText = `According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a
bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body
off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what
humans think is impossible. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we
saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna
take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that.
- Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees
cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks,
dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being
poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's
awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no
talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz,
buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for
this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. -
Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts,
check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped
stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm
out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue
Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30
degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a
kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a
pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do
we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more
honey for us. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we
need those? Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again?
You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the
coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. `;
